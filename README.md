# Udacity_Analyze_A-B_test_results
Analysis of Udacity project A/B test.

### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


#### Part 1:
Find out the conversion rates difference between new and old pages using probabilities.

#### Part 2:
 Perform A/B test and compare the results with that of part 1.
 
#### Part 3:
Investigate the impact of countries on P-value and hypothesis through logistic regression.
